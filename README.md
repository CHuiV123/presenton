**Presenton** is an open-source (Apache 2.0) app that runs locally on your device, giving you full control over your presentation workflow. Generate beautiful decks using powerful AI models like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others — all while keeping your data private and compliant. You bring your own API keys and choose the provider, ensuring no third-party service stores or processes your content beyond the AI model you select.
