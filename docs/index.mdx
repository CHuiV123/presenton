**Presenton** is an open-source, privacy-first AI presentation generator that runs entirely on your local machine. Designed as a powerful alternative to cloud-based tools like Gamma, Presenton gives users full control over their data and the flexibility to use large language models (LLMs) of their choice.

With support for models like **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, and **Ollama**, Presenton allows you to generate high-quality, customizable presentations from simple prompts or document inputs. You can export your slides in PPTX or PDF format and even use GPU-accelerated open-source models for faster, offline generation.

Presenton is built with simplicity, flexibility, and transparency in mind â€” with no tracking, no vendor lock-in, and no hidden costs. Whether you're creating technical decks, business reports, or educational materials, Presenton empowers you to generate presentations securely and efficiently.
